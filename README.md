This repository demonstrates a potential runtime error in TypeScript when dealing with optional properties in object types. The `bug.ts` file contains code that might throw an error if an input object is missing a property.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a solution using optional chaining or type guards to handle missing properties gracefully.  This is a common issue, especially when dealing with external data where the structure might not always be perfectly predictable.
